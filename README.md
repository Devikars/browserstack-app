If you’re a developer who enjoys this project, I could use help developing the following features: 

- Integrating the local testing extension to test private and internal servers.
- Support for launching individual URLs from the menu or command line.
- Support for switching browser, version, or desktop OS from the menu or command line.
- Support for resizing the window from a list of common presets from the menu or command line.
